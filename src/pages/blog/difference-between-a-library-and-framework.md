Most guys I actually came across in tech ignorantly misunderstood/misused the word Library and Framework. I mean, **in this 21st century life of programming, you should know that**.

*Hey tech dude, it’s a library not a framework, okay?*

Well, since you’re reading this now, keep reading so you don’t mess up again.

## What’s a Library?
These are just codes written by other developers, so it’s simply just a code reuse. You might just need a function to draw some sets of shapes for you. For example Turtle in Python which is a library.


```javascript
{
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/pages`,
        name: "pages",
      },
    }
```
