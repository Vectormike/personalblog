Yes! Docker is one of the best things that has happened to Software development in recent years.

Just incase youdon't now what the hell Docker is, no better understanding of Docker or you need quick steps to use Docker, then you should read on.

Docker, quite intimidating at first, but its importance which allows the use of containers can be easily handled when understood.

As our application grows, it becomes Monolithic, a self-contaned computing application that performs every function/service. This becomes harder to manage. For example, let's say we're building a Node application that would be integrated with other libraries; a certain versionof Node has to work with certain versions of other libraries/dependencies which works with your Operating system. Most often, if another team member runs that Node project/application on a different machine or computer they encounter errors.

This has to do with the different environment(my machine or computer could be different from yours). We then need a way to run that Node application on every environment without errors.
